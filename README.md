# Spam-or-not-spam-classifier
Built a classifier to classify emails as spam or non-spam. We used the Kaggle dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ozlerhakan/spam-or-not-spam-dataset">Spam or Not Spam Dataset</a> for this task.

Steps performed :

- Used the **Bag-of-Words** representation to process the text.
- Visualized the frequency of word-occurence in all the emails.
- Used **SVM** and **K-Nearest Neighbour** to build the classifier.
